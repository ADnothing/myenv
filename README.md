# Bash Scientific Environment

As a master student in Space Science and technologies, I have to use a lot my computer and programming languages. This repository contains the scripts I use in my bin in order to save time while working. My goal is to create a maximum of those can of scripts for different needs in different languages and save them here so everyone that found it useful can use it too.

If you want to use my scripts : make sure to change the path in all the script files, else it may not work. Also put the content of "bin" in the bin of your computer, or include the directory in the path of your .bashrc. I advises you also to use aliases, here are some exemple :

  - alias cbuild='bash crea_c.sh'
  - alias pybuild='bash crea_py.sh'
  - alias save_bin='bash save_bin.sh'
