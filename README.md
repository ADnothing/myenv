# myenv
This repository contains the script I use in my bin in order to save time while working.

If you want to use my scripts : make sure to change the path in all the script files, else it may not work. Also put the content of "bin" in the bin of your computer, or include the directory in the path of your .bashrc. I advises you also to use aliases, here are some exemple :

  - alias cbuild='bash crea_c.sh'
  - alias pybuild='bash crea_py.sh'
  - alias save_bin='bash save_bin.sh'
